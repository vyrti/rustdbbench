| Category             | Optimization Idea               | Status               | Analysis & Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| Locking & Concurrency | Use parking_lot::Mutex or RwLock | ✅ Done              | We have implemented parking_lot::RwLock, which is a top-tier choice for read-heavy workloads.                                                                                                                                  |
|                      | Use DashMap                    | ❌ Not Using          | We are using a manually sharded Vec<RwLock<...>>. This is a deliberate choice. For our specific workload (many keys, high concurrency), manual sharding often outperforms DashMap by having more predictable performance and avoiding DashMap's internal contention points. The current solution is excellent. |
|                      | Use RwLock instead of Mutex    | ✅ Done              | This was a key optimization to allow concurrent reads, which we've implemented.                                                                                                                                                 |
|                      | Increase Shard Count           | ✅ Done              | We are using 256 shards, a solid number for distributing load. The "new" list suggests 1024; this is a tunable parameter that could be tested, but 256 is already very good.                                                      |
|                      | Pin Threads to Cores (CPU Affinity) | ❌ Not Using          | This is a system-level optimization that would require a crate like core_affinity_rs. It's an advanced technique for reducing cache misses and could provide a performance boost, especially under heavy, consistent load.         |
|                      | Use SO_REUSEPORT for Listeners | ❌ Not Using          | Another system-level optimization for handling massive inbound connection bursts on Linux. It would require the socket2 crate. It's an advanced technique for hyper-scaling the connection-accepting part of the server.           |
|                      | Thread-Per-Core Architecture  | ❌ Not Using          | This is a fundamental rewrite (the "ScyllaDB model") that represents the pinnacle of shared-nothing design. It's the most complex and highest-performance pattern possible, but our current shared-state model is already very fast. |
| Data Structures      | Use smallvec to avoid heap allocations | ✅ Done              | We are correctly using SmallVec for our RespFrame::Array.                                                                                                                                                                       |
|                      | Use VecDeque for O(1) LPUSH   | ❌ Not Using          | This is an excellent point from the new list. Our current SmallVec (and Vec) has O(n) performance for lpush because it has to shift all existing elements. VecDeque is a double-ended queue designed for O(1) push/pop from both ends. This is a major remaining optimization. |
| Allocations & Memory | Use itoa to avoid format!      | ✅ Done              | This was a critical optimization to remove heap allocations from the response hot path.                                                                                                                                         |
|                      | Pre-allocate common responses | ❌ Not Using          | A good idea for things like +OK\r\n or +PONG\r\n. We currently use Bytes::from_static which is nearly as good, as it points to static memory and doesn't allocate. The performance gain would be minimal but it's a valid technique. |
|                      | Use Bytes and zero-copy parsing | ✅ Done              | Our RespCodec is built around Bytes and BytesMut to minimize copying.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Parsing & Encoding   | Custom, non-UTF8 integer parser | ✅ Done              | We implemented a fast, direct bytes -> i64 parser.                                                                                                                                                                              |
|                      | Fast CRLF detection           | ✅ Done              | Our windows(2).position() is fast and idiomatic. The suggestion of a manual loop is a micro-optimization with very little expected gain.                                                                                         |
|                      | Case-insensitive command matching | ✅ Done              | We are using .to_ascii_uppercase() on the command name, which is a standard and reasonably efficient way to handle this. The new list's idea of byte-level matching is a clever micro-optimization.                              |
| Algorithms           | Use bitwise AND for sharding  | ✅ Done              | We are using bitwise AND (& (SHARDS - 1)) which is faster than modulo.                                                                                                                                                          |
|                      | Proper Redis index normalization | ❌ Not Using          | Another excellent point from the new list. Redis allows negative indices for LRANGE (e.g., -1 means the last element). Our current implementation doesn't handle this correctly. Fixing this is more about correctness than performance, but it's critical for true compatibility. |
| Build & System       | Link-Time Optimization (LTO)  | ⚠️ Not Done (Config) | This is a critical build-time flag set in Cargo.toml. We have not added the [profile.maxperf] to the server's Cargo.toml yet. This is the most important non-code change remaining.                                             |
|                      | codegen-units = 1             | ⚠️ Not Done (Config) | Goes hand-in-hand with LTO for maximum compiler optimization.                                                                                                                                                                   |
|                      | TCP_NODELAY                   | ✅ Done              | We are setting this on all connections.
